##  Features
- Create, view, update, and delete tasks
- Toggle completion
- Real-time updates after each action

| GET    | `/tasks`         | Get all tasks       |
| POST   | `/tasks`         | Add a task          |
| PUT    | `/tasks/:id`     | Update task         |
| DELETE | `/tasks/:id`     | Delete task         |

### Sample Payloads

**POST /tasks**
```json
{
  "title": "Buy Groceries",

##  Future Improvements
- Add database (MongoDB)
- User authentication
- Filters/sorting

### âœ… Why did you choose this project structure?

I split the project into two folders: `client/` for the frontend (Next.js + Tailwind) and `server/` for the backend (Express). This just felt like the cleanest way to separate concerns â€” it keeps everything modular and easier to manage.

Having them in their own spaces means I can work on the frontend UI without worrying about backend logic breaking things, and vice versa. Plus, it makes scaling or even deploying them independently a lot simpler down the line. If someone else joins the project, they can jump into either side without too much context-switching.

---

### âœ… How did you separate frontend and backend concerns?

The frontend is pretty much focused on the user experience â€” rendering the tasks, handling forms, and calling APIs using `axios`. It doesnâ€™t mess with business logic or try to manage the state of tasks itself. Everything comes through HTTP calls.

The backend (Express) takes care of everything under the hood: storing tasks, validating data, and handling CRUD logic. For example, when a user adds a task, the frontend just sends the input to the server, and the server decides what to do with it. Keeping that boundary clean really helps keep bugs and confusion to a minimum.

---

### âœ… How would you handle errors and edge cases?

**On the frontend:**

* Iâ€™d wrap API calls in `try/catch` blocks so users get a friendly message if something fails instead of a blank screen.
* Also, simple validation â€” like requiring a title before submitting a task â€” helps catch issues early.
* I'd probably disable the "Add" button while a request is in progress too, just to prevent duplicate submissions.

**On the backend:**

* Iâ€™d use `express-validator` or a similar library to make sure incoming data is clean.
* Also planning to return proper HTTP status codes â€” like `400` for bad input or `404` for missing tasks â€” so the frontend knows how to respond.
* Iâ€™d also throw in centralized error handling middleware to avoid repeating `try/catch` everywhere.

**Edge cases I'd handle:**

* Blocking tasks with empty or duplicate titles.
* Returning a 404 if someone tries to update/delete a task that doesnâ€™t exist.
* Gracefully handling things like network failures or the server being down.

### âœ… What security features would you add in production?

Some of the key things Iâ€™d set up:

* **CORS**: Right now it's open, but Iâ€™d lock it down to only allow requests from my frontend domain.
* **Rate Limiting**: Adding something like `express-rate-limit` to stop bots or malicious spam.
* **Helmet**: Itâ€™s a quick win for setting secure HTTP headers against common attacks.
* **Input Validation/Sanitization**: Making sure no one sends malicious scripts or junk into the system.
* **HTTPS**: Definitely needed for secure communication once deployed.
* If I were supporting multiple users:

  * Iâ€™d use JWTs or sessions for authentication
  * Probably add role-based access so only certain users can modify/delete things

---

### âœ… What would you improve if you had 1 full day?

**1. Persistent Storage**
Iâ€™d swap out the in-memory task list for a real database â€” probably PostgreSQL â€” using Prisma or Sequelize. Also, I'd move away from using timestamps as IDs and generate proper UUIDs.

**2. Auth System**
Iâ€™d build a simple login/signup system with hashed passwords (probably using `bcrypt`). That would make it ready for multi-user support.

**3. Better UX**
A few things Iâ€™d improve on the interface:

* Add filters (e.g., show only completed tasks)
* Inline task editing so users donâ€™t have to delete and re-add
* Loading spinners or some status text so people know whatâ€™s happening

**4. Deployment**
Iâ€™d get the frontend live on Vercel and use something like Render or Railway for the backend. That way, itâ€™s fully accessible and shareable.

**5. Testing**
I'd add some basic tests â€” maybe with Jest for the backend and React Testing Library on the frontend â€” just to make sure things donâ€™t break when adding features.
